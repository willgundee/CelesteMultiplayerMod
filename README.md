# CelesteMultiplayerMod
This mod has for objective to make Celeste playable in multiplayer

I added two classes in Celeste.mod.mm/patches PlayerTwo.cs and Input.cs

PlayerTwo.cs exist only to diferenciate P1 and P2 and act just like a normal player
Input.cs is used to separate P1 and P2 controls

for the moment P2 screen transition are a bit buggy and P2 can't interact with most object 

P2 won't spawn until P1 dies once

Also I don't know yet how to make a good setting menu so P2 controls are hardcoded

If you want to help or give suggestion go ahead and tell me on the Discord server

TODO
-Fix P2 screen transition
-Make P2 spawn at the begining of a level
-Make a menu for P2 controls keybinds
-Make P2 able to interact with objects (such as block that move when the player is on it)

Possible future feature
-Online play
-Really cool vs idea that I just thought of
