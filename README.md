# CelesteMultiplayerMod
This mod has for objective to make Celeste playable in multiplayer

for the moment P2 screen transition are a bit buggy and P2 can't interact with most object 

P2 won't spawn until P1 dies once

Also I don't know yet how to make a good setting menu so P2 controls are hardcoded

If you want to help or give suggestion go ahead and tell me on the Celeste Discord server in #game_modding

### TODO
- Fix P2 screen transition
- Make a menu for P2 controls keybinds
- Make P2 able to interact with objects (such as block that move when the player is on it)

### Possible future feature
- Online play
- Really cool vs idea that I just thought of
